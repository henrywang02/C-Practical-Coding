### Object-Oriented Programming Overview
During my studies at JAMK University of Applied Sciences, I gained a strong foundation in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), focusing primarily on C#. I used Visual Studio 2022 to implement and solve practical problems, allowing me to develop a hands-on understanding of core OOP concepts.

Key concepts I mastered include:

- Encapsulation: Structuring code with proper access modifiers to enhance security and modularity.
- Inheritance: Building hierarchical relationships between classes to promote code reuse.
- Polymorphism: Implementing dynamic behavior and method overriding for flexible and scalable solutions.
- Abstraction: Designing clear interfaces and abstract classes to simplify complex systems.

Through practical exercises and projects, I applied these principles to solve real-world problems, reinforcing my ability to design and implement robust and maintainable applications.
